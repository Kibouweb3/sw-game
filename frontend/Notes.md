## Front-end to-do

- Whenever a new address is connected, either click a null ship, or click the original ship BUT show "Info" only
- Responsiveness: deliver map length to transform component children using getComputedStyle()?

- Add Error boundary
- Re-structure folder structures

### Simulated state (check using block.timestamp)

- zone shrink
- people outside zone -1 point every day
- AP increase 1 every day

- function that returns game state (zone size, units)
- events to change the game state
- event UnitMoved(uint256 tokenId, uint256 x, uint256 y);
- event UnitDamaged(uint256 tokenId, uint256 newHealth);
- event UnitUpgraded(uint256 tokenId, uint256 level);
- event UnitBalanceChange(uint256 tokenId, uint256 newBalance);
